# Description
Console application created to demonstrate ability to design clean, readable code. This is not a complete app, it intended as a sample.


# Architecture
Broken out in multiple functions, some a bit unnecessary but intended for future development and readability.
ES6 syntax
this app is capable of handling the 4 standard operators ( +, -, *, / ).
There is some error handling although not all cases are covered.
 App does not depend on any packages so an npm install is not required.
 
 
 # Trade-offs
Normally I would use a package or 2 to simplyify and save time.
If I were to spend more time on this project I would add additional error handling on the various inputs a user might have. Continue to add/improve 
the user interface Console apps are not always user friendly. When a user begins to
provide a more complex input, it becomes increasingly challenging to error handle and prevent any short comings.

# How To Run
To Start APP Simply enter "node app.js" through terminal while in the associated directory.
